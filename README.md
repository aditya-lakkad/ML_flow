# MLflow: Mastering the Machine Learning Lifecycle üöÄ

## üìå Overview
This repository provides an in-depth exploration of **MLflow**, an open-source platform designed to manage the complete machine learning lifecycle. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced data scientist, this repo walks you through the **4 key MLflow components**:

- **Tracking**: Log and query experiments, metrics, and parameters.
- **Projects**: Pack ML code into a reusable and reproducible format.
- **Models**: Manage and deploy machine learning models across multiple platforms.
- **Model Registry**: A centralized model store for collaboration and version control.

## üí° Why Use MLflow?
Machine learning workflows can get messy: different environments, numerous experiments, and a growing number of models. **MLflow simplifies the process** by providing:

- **Experiment Tracking**: Keep track of multiple runs with varying hyperparameters.
- **Reproducibility**: Recreate experiments with ease using versioned code and environments.
- **Model Deployment**: Seamlessly transition from experimentation to production.
- **Collaboration**: Share models and insights across teams with the Model Registry.

## üîß Key Use Cases

### 1. **Experiment Tracking**
   - Log metrics, parameters, and artifacts during model training.
   - Compare runs and visualize performance trends using the MLflow UI.

### 2. **Reproducibility**
   - Use MLflow Projects to create portable and shareable ML code.
   - Environment dependencies are automatically managed using `conda.yaml` or Docker.

### 3. **Model Management**
   - Store, version, and manage trained models using the Model Registry.
   - Deploy models to cloud platforms or local environments with minimal effort.

### 4. **Serving Models**
   - Use MLflow Models to deploy via REST APIs or integrate with platforms like **Azure ML**, **AWS Sagemaker**, or **Databricks**.
